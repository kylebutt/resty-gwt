    ## Snapshots

    Want to help stablize the latest and greatest nightly development
    build?  **Warnning**: This build may be extremely bleeding edge!

    *  [#{project_id}-#{project_snapshot_version}.jar](http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.fusesource.#{project_id}&a=#{project_id}&v=#{project_snapshot_version}&e=jar)

    # As a Maven Dependency

.right
  :&markdown

    If your a maven user, then just add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`

    {pygmentize::xml}
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.fusesource.#{project_id}</groupId>
      <artifactId>#{project_id}</artifactId>
      <version>#{project_version}</version>
    </dependency>
    {pygmentize}    

    If you are using a snapshot version, then you will also need to 
    also add the following snapshot repository to your pom:
  
    {pygmentize::xml}
    <repository>
      <id>fusesource-snapshots</id>
      <name>Fusesource Snapshots</name>
      <url>http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
      <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
    </repository>
    {pygmentize}
