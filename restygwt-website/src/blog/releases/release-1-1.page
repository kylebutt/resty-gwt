the release of RestyGWT 1.1. RestyGWT is a

* New [`Dispatcher`](${website_base_url}/documentation/restygwt-user-guide.html#Request_Dispatchers) support allow you to plugin in custom service interceptors
* Added Jackson style polymorphic JSON encoding/decoding
* Support the JAXRS @Produces/@Consumes annotations
* Added @Options to declaratively configure many request options such as timeout values
* Support void callbacks
